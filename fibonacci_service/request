Fibonacci package: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . . The next number is found
by adding up the two numbers before it. Develop a ROS Service taking
2 numbers (index, length) as input and returning a portion of the
fibonacci sequence:
• The first argument of the service represents the index of an ele-
ment along the fibonacci sequence:
f[0] = 0, f[1] = 1, f[2] = 1, f[3] = 2, ...
• The second argument represent the number of element to return
• Starting from the index element of the sequence, return the next
length element of the sequence.
Example:
Input: ( 8, 3 ), Output: 21, 34, 55
f[8] = 21, f[7] = 13 -> f[9] = 21+13 = 34
